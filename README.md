## Overview

This is my solution to the [Frontend Mentor Challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/). The project was built using HTML, CSS, Sass, Flexbox, and Grid layout to create a fully responsive design.

### The Challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## Links

- Website  URL: (https://ahmedrashadmansour.github.io/personal-website/)


## Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Sass for reusable styles
- Flexbox for flexible layouts
- CSS Grid for advanced layouts


## What I Learned

Through this challenge, I solidified my understanding of:

- Creating reusable components with Sass mixins and variables
- Using Flexbox for flexible and responsive layout structures
- Implementing CSS Grid for complex, multi-column layouts
